Game Update
Taylor M

	I ran into some major issues this week with my games progress,  after spending most of the week
	programming my game grid and other event handlers my computer crash this last sunday and i lost almost all 
	of my files including all of my web files.  My cloud had failed to update for the last 2 weeks. WHile I was able to 
	recover my assignment 3 files from canvas, they were all extremely out of date.  This has led me to frantically try
	and redo a full weeks worth of work in one day, while working and with my other classes.
	
	
	As far as progress goes with my functions, I have Added Several Getter functions that recover Model variables, I use these
	to update my view with their own seperate functions. In addition i have added a little rock animation and added an input box along with a button submit.
	Unfortunately i was unable to finish adding click handlers to my Game Board.
	
	Game logic
	
	-Move units logic, each unit has his own unique move set
	Progress: Pawn programmed but needs work. Will finsih after click handlers
	
	
	Attach Logic- Need to program the attack logic behind each character.
	Progress: While I have the logic maped out on paper , I need to progres with click handlers to proceed.
	
	Update state, with moves- Need to link game state with each move.
	
	Need to determine game end rules.
